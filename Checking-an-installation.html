<h3 class="section">6.4 Checking an installation</h3>

<p>Once compiled and site initialization is set up you should test
to see if Festival can speak or not.

   <p>Start the system
<pre class="example">     $ bin/festival
     Festival Speech Synthesis System 1.4.3:release Jan 2003
     Copyright (C) University of Edinburgh, 1996-2003. All rights reserved.
     For details type `(festival_warranty)'
     festival&gt; ^D
</pre>
   <p>If errors occur at this stage they are most likely to do
with pathname problems.  If any error messages are printed
about non-existent files check that those pathnames
point to where you intended them to be.  Most of the (default)
pathnames are dependent on the basic library path.  Ensure that
is correct.  To find out what it has been set to, start the
system without loading the init files.
<pre class="example">     $ bin/festival -q
     Festival Speech Synthesis System 1.4.3:release Jan 2003
     Copyright (C) University of Edinburgh, 1996-2003. All rights reserved.
     For details type `(festival_warranty)'
     festival&gt; libdir
     "/projects/festival/lib/"
     festival&gt; ^D
</pre>
   <p>This should show the pathname you set in your <samp><span class="file">config/config</span></samp>.

   <p>If the system starts with no errors try to synthesize something
<pre class="example">     festival&gt; (SayText "hello world")
</pre>
   <p>Some files are only accessed at synthesis time so this may
show up other problem pathnames.  If it talks, you're in business,
if it doesn't, here are some possible problems.

   <p><a name="index-audio-problems-47"></a>If you get the error message
<pre class="example">     Can't access NAS server
</pre>
   <p>You have selected NAS as the audio output but have no server running on
that machine or your <code>DISPLAY</code> or <code>AUDIOSERVER</code> environment
variable is not set properly for your output device.  Either set these
properly or change the audio output device in <samp><span class="file">lib/siteinit.scm</span></samp> as
described above.

   <p>Ensure your audio device actually works the way you think it does.  On
Suns, the audio output device can be switched into a number of different
output modes, speaker, jack, headphones.  If this is set to the wrong
one you may not hear the output.  Use one of Sun's tools to change this
(try <samp><span class="file">/usr/demo/SOUND/bin/soundtool</span></samp>).  Try to find an audio
file independent of Festival and get it to play on your audio. 
Once you have done that ensure that the audio output method set in
Festival matches that.

   <p>Once you have got it talking, test the audio spooling device.
<pre class="example">     festival&gt; (intro)
</pre>
   <p>This plays a short introduction of two sentences, spooling the audio
output.

   <p>Finally exit from Festival (by end of file or <code>(quit)</code>) and test
the script mode with.
<pre class="example">     $ examples/saytime
</pre>
   <p>A test suite is included with Festival but it makes certain assumptions
about which voices are installed.  It assumes that
<code>voice_rab_diphone</code> (<samp><span class="file">festvox_rabxxxx.tar.gz</span></samp>) is the default
voice and that <code>voice_ked_diphone</code> and <code>voice_don_diphone</code>
(<samp><span class="file">festvox_kedxxxx.tar.gz</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">festvox_don.tar.gz</span></samp>) are
installed.  Also local settings in your <samp><span class="file">festival/lib/siteinit.scm</span></samp>
may affect these tests.  However, after installation it may
be worth trying
<pre class="example">     gnumake test
</pre>
   <p>from the <samp><span class="file">festival/</span></samp> directory.  This will do various tests
including basic utterance tests and tokenization tests.  It also checks
that voices are installed and that they don't interfere with each other. 
These tests are primarily regression tests for the developers of
Festival, to ensure new enhancements don't mess up existing supported
features.  They are not designed to test an installation is successful,
though if they run correctly it is most probable the installation has
worked.
