<h2 class="chapter">2 Copying</h2>

<p><a name="index-restrictions-1"></a><a name="index-redistribution-2"></a>As we feeel the core system has reached an acceptable level of maturity
from 1.4.0 the basic system is released under a free lience, without the
commercial restrictions we imposed on early versions. The basic system
has been placed under an X11 type licence which as free licences go is
pretty free.  No GPL code is included in festival or the speech tools
themselves (though some auxiliary files are GPL'd e.g. the Emacs mode
for Festival).  We have deliberately choosen a licence that should be
compatible with our commercial partners and our free software users.

   <p>However although the code is free, we still offer no warranties and no
maintenance.  We will continue to endeavor to fix bugs and answer
queries when can, but are not in a position to guarantee it.  We will
consider maintenance contracts and consultancy if desired, please
contacts us for details.

   <p>Also note that not all the voices and lexicons we distribute with
festival are free.  Particularly the British English lexicon derived
from Oxford Advanced Learners' Dictionary is free only for
non-commercial use (we will release an alternative soon).  Also the
Spanish diphone voice we relase is only free for non-commercial use.

   <p>If you are using Festival or the speech tools in commercial environment,
even though no licence is required, we would be grateful if you let us
know as it helps justify ourselves to our various sponsors.
