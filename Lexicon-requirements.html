<h3 class="section">13.6 Lexicon requirements</h3>

<p><a name="index-lexicon-requirements-172"></a>For English there are a number of assumptions made about the lexicon
which are worthy of explicit mention.  If you are basically going to use
the existing token rules you should try to include at least the
following in any lexicon that is to work with them.

     <ul>
<li>The letters of the alphabet, when a token is identified as an acronym it
is spelled out.  The tokenization assumes that the individual letters of
the alphabet are in the lexicon with their pronunciations.  They
should be identified as nouns.  (This is to distinguish <code>a</code> as
a determiner which can be schwa'd from <code>a</code> as a letter which
cannot.)  The part of speech should be <code>nn</code> by default, but the
value of the variable <code>token.letter_pos</code> is used and may be
changed if this is not what is required. 
<li>One character symbols such as dollar, at-sign, percent etc.  Its
difficult to get a complete list and to know what the pronunciation of
some of these are (e.g hash or pound sign).  But the letter to sound
rules cannot deal with them so they need to be explicitly listed.  See
the list in the function <code>mrpa_addend</code> in
<samp><span class="file">festival/lib/dicts/oald/oaldlex.scm</span></samp>.  This list should
also contain the control characters and eight bit characters. 
<li><a name="index-possessives-173"></a>The possessive <code>'s</code> should be in your lexicon as schwa and voiced
fricative (<code>z</code>).  It should be in twice, once as part speech type
<code>pos</code> and once as <code>n</code> (used in plurals of numbers acronyms
etc. e.g 1950's).  <code>'s</code> is treated as a word and is separated from
the tokens it appears with.  The post-lexical rule (the function
<code>postlex_apos_s_check</code>) will delete the schwa and devoice the <code>z</code>
in appropriate contexts.  Note this post-lexical rule brazenly assumes
that the unvoiced fricative in the phoneset is <code>s</code>.  If it
is not in your phoneset copy the function (it is in
<samp><span class="file">festival/lib/postlex.scm</span></samp>) and change it for your phoneset
and use your version as a post-lexical rule. 
<li><a name="index-NO-digits-174"></a>Numbers as digits (e.g. "1", "2", "34", etc.) should normally
<em>not</em> be in the lexicon.  The number conversion routines
convert numbers to words (i.e. "one", "two", "thirty four", etc.). 
<li><a name="index-unknown-words-175"></a>The word "unknown" or whatever is in the variable
<code>token.unknown_word_name</code>.  This is used in a few obscure cases
when there just isn't anything that can be said (e.g. single characters
which aren't in the lexicon).  Some people have suggested it should be
possible to make this a sound rather than a word.  I agree, but Festival
doesn't support that yet. 
</ul>
