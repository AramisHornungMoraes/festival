<h3 class="section">22.3 Synthesizers in development</h3>

<p>In addition to the above synthesizers Festival also
supports CSTR's older PSOLA synthesizer written by Paul Taylor. 
But as the newer diphone synthesizer produces similar quality
output and is a newer (and hence a cleaner) implementation
further development of the older module is unlikely.

   <p><a name="index-selection_002dbased-synthesis-287"></a>An experimental unit seleciton synthesis module is included in
<samp><span class="file">modules/clunits/</span></samp> it is an implementation of <cite>black97c</cite>.  It
is included for people wishing to continue reserach in the area rather
than as a fully usable waveform synthesis engine.  Although it sometimes
gives excellent results it also sometimes gives amazingly bad ones too. 
We included this as an example of one possible framework for selection-based
synthesis.

   <p>As one of our funded projects is to specifically develop new selection
based synthesis algorithms we expect to include more models within later
versions of the system.

   <p>Also, now that Festival has been released other groups are working
on new synthesis techniques in the system.  Many of these will
become available and where possible we will give pointers from
the Festival home page to them.  Particularly there is an alternative
residual excited LPC module implemented at the Center for Spoken
Language Understanding (CSLU) at the Oregon Graduate Institute (OGI).
